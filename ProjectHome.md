Status: Pre-Alpha | Source Checked In: Yes | Release Available: No | Documentation: None (see gnucash documentation) |

The plan is to target any platform that supports .NET or Mono: Solaris, Linux, Windows, Mac, (BSD?). It will start out as a porting project of gnucash.

The first milestone is set for September 30, 2006 and will have the following features:
1. Open an existing gnucash file.
2. Choose existing account.
3. Edit existing transactions.
4. Create new transactions.
5. Save file.
6. Be able to open up file in gnucash again.

So the intent of the first release is to give you a 'lite' version of gnucash. You will not be able to create/delete accounts or commodities, etc.


Thanks for stopping by,
