Classes also know how to serialize/deserialize themselves.

These classes correspond to the engine strucutres of gnucash.

The following link gives a schema (but it doesn't look complete)
http://svn.gnucash.org/trac/browser/gnucash/trunk/src/doc/xml/gnucash-v2.rnc

There is also a link to a page that tells you how to read the schema.
